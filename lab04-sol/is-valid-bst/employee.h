};

/* Your task is to ensure that the structure employee_t is totally ordered.
 * Note that the indexing of the employees is based fir on the department
 * name, then on the id_in_department. It is guaranteed that the combination
 * of department_name and id_in_department is unique.
 *
 * You should not modify the existing structure. Your task is to implement
 * comparators for the structure employee_t. Do read up on the C++20 spaceship
 * operator to understand how to implement the comparison operators, as that is
 * much faster to write than overloading the comparison operators individually.
 * Note that you still need to overload equality (==) operator alongwith the
 * spaceship (<=>) operator.
 *
 * As long as the final code is complied correctly and the ordering is done by
 * you correctly, you can add any helper functions you need and modify the 
 * TODO section as you see fit. Note that "correct ordering" implies that the
 * ordering is done based on the department_name first (alphabetical, just like
 * in a dictionary), and then on the id_in_department (numerical, ascending).
 *
 * Lastly, do not add `using namespace std;` as it is a bad practice.
 * The full problem involves the above task AND the task in the file
 * "is_valid_bst.h". You should complete both tasks.
